    "Technically, you could write an entire program without using any functions. However, this would be an incredibly bad idea. Your full program could end up being thousands of lines long, and/or difficult to debug. It's generally considered good practice to factor your code into functions. Here are a few reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions Reduce Redundancy**: Often, you will want the exact same or very similar tasks multiple times in your program. Rather than writing the same code multiple times, which would be redundant, you can factor that code into a function that can be called throughout your program to perform that task. We can even use parameters and returns to create functions that are even more modular to further reduce redundancy. If you are tempted to copy/paste code, you should probably be using a function!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions Represent Tasks**: Even if code isn't redundant, it can still be a good idea to factor it into a function. Factoring code into functions with distinct tasks also makes it easier to reuse your code. If there's a function where you perform 2 tasks, and then later you want to only perform one of those tasks, you couldn't call your existing function because you don't want to perform both tasks. It would be better to structure each task into its own function to make it more reusable."

One-line functions can be non-trivial if you are factoring a common calculation into a functions, for instance, but with functions with so little code, you should generally consider whether or not the function is improving your program."
