# ME-programming-fundamentals
This repository contains lecture notes and homework assignments from "Programming Fundamentals for Mechanical Engineers", a course designed by *Aidan Hunt* and taught at the University of Washington. This course was created to provide mechanical engineering students with a strong, broadly applicable programming foundation and literacy. Although the course is taught in Python, the skills in the curriculum extend to other programming languages, such as MATLAB.

## Learning Objectives
After working through this course material, you will be able to:
- Recognize key programming concepts and tools that exist across programming languages, and implement these concepts and tools in Python.
- Utilize Python programming to process real data, perform analysis, and create high-quality graphics.
- Decompose engineering-related programming problems into distinct sub-problems, and develop well-structured, readable code.

## Course outline:
- Lectures 01-02: Intro to Python (Homework 1)
- Lectures 03-04: Basic data structures and loops (Homework 2)
- Lectures 05-06: Control flow and logic (Homework 3)
- Lectures 07-08: NumPy (Homework 4)
- Lectures 09-10: Pandas (Homework 5)
- Lectures 11-12: Working with files
- Lectures 13-14: Object-oriented programming (Homework 6)
- Lectures 15-17: Advanced plotting
- Lectures 18: Modules and packages, sharing code
- Lecture 19: Translating to other programming languages (Homework reflections and revisions)
