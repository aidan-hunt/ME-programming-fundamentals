    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a framework for:\n",
    "- Designing your own data structures\n",
    "- Grouping data and corresponding functions/processing methodology together.\n",
    "- Intuitively representing physical objects in the programming space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation: Load Cell\n",
    "- Processing data from load cell occurs in multiple steps. Components may change.\n",
    "- Usual framework: \n",
    "    - Define a function that performs this kind of calculation\n",
    "    - Every time we want to process data, gather the individual pieces (tare, calibration, rotation matrix) and call this function.\n",
    "- OOP framework: create a `LoadCell` **object** that represents the load cell in the programming space.\n",
    "    - This object knows the tare, calibration, rotation of the physical load cell it represents\n",
    "    - This object knows how to process data collected by the physical load cell it represents\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of the Object-Oriented Approach\n",
    "- Can give the `LoadCell` object additional functions (e.g., checking data validity, taking tares, estimating rotation matrix) \n",
    "- More interactive\n",
    "- Streamlines processing for multiple load cells\n",

    "We've been using objects this whole time!\n",

    "## A simple example of object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "*(See slides on course website)*\n",
    "\n",
    "An object encapsulates **state** and **behavior**. To unpack what this means, consider an object that represents something that many of us have interacted with: a Music Player (e.g., an iPod).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### State\n",
    "**State** of an object is data that describes the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Music Player state could be described by:\n",
    "- The on/off state\n",
    "- The volume\n",
    "- A list of songs\n",
    "- The color\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior\n",
    "**Behavior** of an object are actions that the object can perform. Behaviors often, but not always, operate on the object's state. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our Music Player, its behaviors could be:\n",
    "- Turning the music player on or off.\n",
    "- Increasing or decreasing the volume.\n",
    "- Selecting a song from the list of songs.\n",
    "- Adding a new song to the list of songs.\n",
    "- Shuffling the song list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "An object should **encapsulate** its state and behavior to guide the user experience. The user shouldn't need to know how the object works \"under the hood\" in order to use it.\n",
    " - You don't know all the details about how your Music Player is designed or implemented, but you know how to use it!\n",
    " - Think about the objects that we have used so far (e.g., NumPy arrays).\n",
    "     - Don't know how they are implemented in Python\n",
    "     - But we can easily use them via their associated methods\n",
    "     \n",
    "### Implementing Objects\n",
    "A `class` is a blueprint for how to make an object.\n",
    "- This blueprint defines what it means to be a member of that class.\n",
    "- When you create an instance of a class, you are creating an object from the blueprint. Objects are individuals, even though they share the same blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "A class can build upon existing classes and add new state/behavior to the existing blueprint.\n",
    "- This is called \"inheritance\"\n",
    "- This is a way of factoring out redundancy between similar objects"
